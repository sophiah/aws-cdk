## Quick Start

This example defines an Amazon EKS cluster with the following configuration:

- Dedicated VPC with default configuration (Implicitly created using [ec2.Vpc](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/aws-ec2-readme.html#vpc))
- A Kubernetes pod with a container based on the [paulbouwer/hello-kubernetes](https://github.com/paulbouwer/hello-kubernetes) image.

```ts
// provisiong a cluster
const cluster = new eks.Cluster(this, 'hello-eks', {
  version: eks.KubernetesVersion.V1_16,
});

// apply a kubernetes manifest to the cluster
cluster.addManifest('mypod', {
  apiVersion: 'v1',
  kind: 'Pod',
  metadata: { name: 'mypod' },
  spec: {
    containers: [
      {
        name: 'hello',
        image: 'paulbouwer/hello-kubernetes:1.5',
        ports: [ { containerPort: 8080 } ]
      }
    ]
  }
});
```

In order to interact with your cluster through `kubectl`, you can use the `aws eks update-kubeconfig` [AWS CLI command](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/eks/update-kubeconfig.html)
to configure your local kubeconfig. The EKS module will define a CloudFormation output in your stack which contains the command to run. For example:

```
Outputs:
ClusterConfigCommand43AAE40F = aws eks update-kubeconfig --name cluster-xxxxx --role-arn arn:aws:iam::112233445566:role/yyyyy
```

Execute the `aws eks update-kubeconfig ... ` command in your terminal to create or update a local kubeconfig context:

```console
$ aws eks update-kubeconfig --name cluster-xxxxx --role-arn arn:aws:iam::112233445566:role/yyyyy
Added new context arn:aws:eks:rrrrr:112233445566:cluster/cluster-xxxxx to /home/boom/.kube/config
```

And now you can simply use `kubectl`:

```console
$ kubectl get all -n kube-system
NAME                           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/aws-node-fpmwv             1/1     Running   0          21m
pod/aws-node-m9htf             1/1     Running   0          21m
pod/coredns-5cb4fb54c7-q222j   1/1     Running   0          23m
pod/coredns-5cb4fb54c7-v9nxx   1/1     Running   0          23m
...
```

In a nutshell:

- `EKS Cluster` - The cluster endpoint created by EKS.
- `Managed Node Group` - EC2 worker nodes managed by EKS.
- `Fargate Profile` - Fargate worker nodes managed by EKS.
- `Auto Scaling Group` - EC2 worker nodes managed by the user.
- `KubectlHandler` - Lambda function for invoking `kubectl` commands on the cluster - created by CDK.
- `ClusterHandler` - Lambda function for interacting with EKS API to manage the cluster lifecycle - created by CDK.

A more detailed breakdown of each is provided further down this README.

## Provisioning clusters

Creating a new cluster is done using the `Cluster` or `FargateCluster` constructs. The only required property is the kubernetes `version`.

```typescript
new eks.Cluster(this, 'HelloEKS', {
  version: eks.KubernetesVersion.V1_17,
});
```

You can also use `FargateCluster` to provision a cluster that uses only fargate workers.

```typescript
new eks.FargateCluster(this, 'HelloEKS', {
  version: eks.KubernetesVersion.V1_17,
});
```

> **NOTE: Only 1 cluster per stack is supported.** If you have a use-case for multiple clusters per stack, or would like to understand more about this limitation, see https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/10073.

Below you'll find a few important cluster configuration options. First of which is Capacity.
Capacity is the amount and the type of worker nodes that are available to the cluster for deploying resources. Amazon EKS offers 3 ways of configuring capacity, which you can combine as you like:

### Managed node groups

Amazon EKS managed node groups automate the provisioning and lifecycle management of nodes (Amazon EC2 instances) for Amazon EKS Kubernetes clusters.
With Amazon EKS managed node groups, you don???t need to separately provision or register the Amazon EC2 instances that provide compute capacity to run your Kubernetes applications. You can create, update, or terminate nodes for your cluster with a single operation. Nodes run using the latest Amazon EKS optimized AMIs in your AWS account while node updates and terminations gracefully drain nodes to ensure that your applications stay available.

> For more details visit [Amazon EKS Managed Node Groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/managed-node-groups.html).

**Managed Node Groups are the recommended way to allocate cluster capacity.**

By default, this library will allocate a managed node group with 2 *m5.large* instances (this instance type suits most common use-cases, and is good value for money).

At cluster instantiation time, you can customize the number of instances and their type:

```typescript
new eks.Cluster(this, 'HelloEKS', {
  version: eks.KubernetesVersion.V1_17,
  defaultCapacity: 5,
  defaultCapacityInstance: ec2.InstanceType.of(ec2.InstanceClass.M5, ec2.InstanceSize.SMALL),
});
```

To access the node group that was created on your behalf, you can use `cluster.defaultNodegroup`.

Additional customizations are available post instantiation. To apply them, set the default capacity to 0, and use the `cluster.addNodegroupCapacity` method:

```typescript
const cluster = new eks.Cluster(this, 'HelloEKS', {
  version: eks.KubernetesVersion.V1_17,
  defaultCapacity: 0,
});

cluster.addNodegroupCapacity('custom-node-group', {
  instanceType: new ec2.InstanceType('m5.large'),
  minSize: 4,
  diskSize: 100,
  amiType: eks.NodegroupAmiType.AL2_X86_64_GPU,
  ...
});
```

#### Launch Template Support

You can specify a launch template that the node group will use. Note that when using a custom AMI, Amazon EKS doesn't merge any user data.
Rather, You are responsible for supplying the required bootstrap commands for nodes to join the cluster.
In the following example, `/ect/eks/bootstrap.sh` from the AMI will be used to bootstrap the node.

```ts
const userData = ec2.UserData.forLinux();
userData.addCommands(
  'set -o xtrace',
  `/etc/eks/bootstrap.sh ${cluster.clusterName}`,
);
const lt = new ec2.CfnLaunchTemplate(this, 'LaunchTemplate', {
  launchTemplateData: {
    imageId: 'some-ami-id', // custom AMI
    instanceType: new ec2.InstanceType('t3.small').toString(),
    userData: Fn.base64(userData.render()),
  },
});
cluster.addNodegroupCapacity('extra-ng', {
  launchTemplateSpec: {
    id: lt.ref,
    version: lt.attrDefaultVersionNumber,
  },
});
```

> For more details visit [Launch Template Support](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_ca/eks/latest/userguide/launch-templates.html).

### Fargate profiles

AWS Fargate is a technology that provides on-demand, right-sized compute
capacity for containers. With AWS Fargate, you no longer have to provision,
configure, or scale groups of virtual machines to run containers. This removes
the need to choose server types, decide when to scale your node groups, or
optimize cluster packing.

You can control which pods start on Fargate and how they run with Fargate
Profiles, which are defined as part of your Amazon EKS cluster.

See [Fargate Considerations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/fargate.html#fargate-considerations) in the AWS EKS User Guide.

You can add Fargate Profiles to any EKS cluster defined in your CDK app
through the `addFargateProfile()` method. The following example adds a profile
that will match all pods from the "default" namespace:

```ts
cluster.addFargateProfile('MyProfile', {
  selectors: [ { namespace: 'default' } ]
});
```

You can also directly use the `FargateProfile` construct to create profiles under different scopes:

```ts
new eks.FargateProfile(scope, 'MyProfile', {
  cluster,
  ...
});
```

To create an EKS cluster that **only** uses Fargate capacity, you can use `FargateCluster`.
The following code defines an Amazon EKS cluster with a default Fargate Profile that matches all pods from the "kube-system" and "default" namespaces. It is also configured to [run CoreDNS on Fargate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/fargate-getting-started.html#fargate-gs-coredns).

```ts
const cluster = new eks.FargateCluster(this, 'MyCluster', {
  version: eks.KubernetesVersion.V1_16,
});
```

**NOTE**: Classic Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers are not supported on
pods running on Fargate. For ingress, we recommend that you use the [ALB Ingress
Controller](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/alb-ingress.html)
on Amazon EKS (minimum version v1.1.4).

### Self-managed nodes

Another way of allocating capacity to an EKS cluster is by using self-managed nodes.
EC2 instances that are part of the auto-scaling group will serve as worker nodes for the cluster.
This type of capacity is also commonly referred to as *EC2 Capacity** or *EC2 Nodes*.

For a detailed overview please visit [Self Managed Nodes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/worker.html).

Creating an auto-scaling group and connecting it to the cluster is done using the `cluster.addAutoScalingGroupCapacity` method:

```ts
cluster.addAutoScalingGroupCapacity('frontend-nodes', {
  instanceType: new ec2.InstanceType('t2.medium'),
  minCapacity: 3,
  vpcSubnets: { subnetType: ec2.SubnetType.PUBLIC }
});
```

You can customize the [/etc/eks/boostrap.sh](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-eks-ami/blob/master/files/bootstrap.sh) script, which is responsible
for bootstrapping the node to the EKS cluster. For example, you can use `kubeletExtraArgs` to add custom node labels or taints.

```ts
cluster.addAutoScalingGroupCapacity('spot', {
  instanceType: new ec2.InstanceType('t3.large'),
  minCapacity: 2,
  bootstrapOptions: {
    kubeletExtraArgs: '--node-labels foo=bar,goo=far',
    awsApiRetryAttempts: 5
  }
});
```

To disable bootstrapping altogether (i.e. to fully customize user-data), set `bootstrapEnabled` to `false`.
You can also configure the cluster to use an auto-scaling group as the default capacity:

```ts
cluster = new eks.Cluster(this, 'HelloEKS', {
  version: eks.KubernetesVersion.V1_17,
  defaultCapacityType: eks.DefaultCapacityType.EC2,
});
```

This will allocate an auto-scaling group with 2 *m5.large* instances (this instance type suits most common use-cases, and is good value for money).
To access the `AutoScalingGroup` that was created on your behalf, you can use `cluster.defaultCapacity`.
You can also independently create an `AutoScalingGroup` and connect it to the cluster using the `cluster.connectAutoScalingGroupCapacity` method:

```ts
const asg = new ec2.AutoScalingGroup(...)
cluster.connectAutoScalingGroupCapacity(asg);
```

This will add the necessary user-data and configure all connections, roles, and tags needed for the instances in the auto-scaling group to properly join the cluster.

#### Spot Instances

When using self-managed nodes, you can configure the capacity to use spot instances, greatly reducing capacity cost.
To enable spot capacity, use the `spotPrice` property:

```ts
cluster.addAutoScalingGroupCapacity('spot', {
  spotPrice: '0.1094',
  instanceType: new ec2.InstanceType('t3.large'),
  maxCapacity: 10
});
```

> Spot instance nodes will be labeled with `lifecycle=Ec2Spot` and tainted with `PreferNoSchedule`.

The [AWS Node Termination Handler](https://github.com/aws/aws-node-termination-handler) `DaemonSet` will be
installed from [Amazon EKS Helm chart repository](https://github.com/aws/eks-charts/tree/master/stable/aws-node-termination-handler) on these nodes.
The termination handler ensures that the Kubernetes control plane responds appropriately to events that
can cause your EC2 instance to become unavailable, such as [EC2 maintenance events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-instances-status-check_sched.html)
and [EC2 Spot interruptions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-interruptions.html) and helps gracefully stop all pods running on spot nodes that are about to be
terminated.

> Handler Version: [1.7.0](https://github.com/aws/aws-node-termination-handler/releases/tag/v1.7.0)
>
> Chart Version: [0.9.5](https://github.com/aws/eks-charts/blob/v0.0.28/stable/aws-node-termination-handler/Chart.yaml)

#### Bottlerocket

[Bottlerocket](https://aws.amazon.com/bottlerocket/) is a Linux-based open-source operating system that is purpose-built by Amazon Web Services for running containers on virtual machines or bare metal hosts.
At this moment, `Bottlerocket` is only supported when using self-managed auto-scaling groups.

> **NOTICE**: Bottlerocket is only available in [some supported AWS regions](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket/blob/develop/QUICKSTART-EKS.md#finding-an-ami).

The following example will create an auto-scaling group of 2 `t3.small` Linux instances running with the `Bottlerocket` AMI.

```ts
cluster.addAutoScalingGroupCapacity('BottlerocketNodes', {
  instanceType: new ec2.InstanceType('t3.small'),
  minCapacity:  2,
  machineImageType: eks.MachineImageType.BOTTLEROCKET
});
```

The specific Bottlerocket AMI variant will be auto selected according to the k8s version for the `x86_64` architecture.
For example, if the Amazon EKS cluster version is `1.17`, the Bottlerocket AMI variant will be auto selected as
`aws-k8s-1.17` behind the scene.

> See [Variants](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket/blob/develop/README.md#variants) for more details.

Please note Bottlerocket does not allow to customize bootstrap options and `bootstrapOptions` properties is not supported when you create the `Bottlerocket` capacity.

### Endpoint Access

When you create a new cluster, Amazon EKS creates an endpoint for the managed Kubernetes API server that you use to communicate with your cluster (using Kubernetes management tools such as `kubectl`)

By default, this API server endpoint is public to the internet, and access to the API server is secured using a combination of
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) and native Kubernetes [Role Based Access Control](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/) (RBAC).

You can configure the [cluster endpoint access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/cluster-endpoint.html) by using the `endpointAccess` property:

```typescript
const cluster = new eks.Cluster(this, 'hello-eks', {
  version: eks.KubernetesVersion.V1_16,
  endpointAccess: eks.EndpointAccess.PRIVATE // No access outside of your VPC.
});
```

### VPC Support

You can specify the VPC of the cluster using the `vpc` and `vpcSubnets` properties:

```ts
const vpc = new ec2.Vpc(this, 'Vpc');

new eks.Cluster(this, 'HelloEKS', {
  version: eks.KubernetesVersion.V1_17,
  vpc,
  vpcSubnets: [{ subnetType: ec2.SubnetType.PRIVATE }]
});
```

If you do not specify a VPC, one will be created on your behalf, which you can then access via `cluster.vpc`. The cluster VPC will be associated to any EKS managed capacity (i.e Managed Node Groups and Fargate Profiles).

If you allocate self managed capacity, you can specify which subnets should the auto-scaling group use:

```ts
const vpc = new ec2.Vpc(this, 'Vpc');
cluster.addAutoScalingGroupCapacity('nodes', {
  vpcSubnets: { subnets: vpc.privateSubnets }
});
```

In addition to the cluster and the capacity, there are two additional components you might want to
provision within a VPC.

#### Kubectl Handler

The `KubectlHandler` is a Lambda function responsible to issuing `kubectl` and `helm` commands against the cluster when you add resource manifests to the cluster.

The handler association to the VPC is derived from the `endpointAccess` configuration. The rule of thumb is: *If the cluster VPC can be associated, it will be*.

Breaking this down, it means that if the endpoint exposes private access (via `EndpointAccess.PRIVATE` or `EndpointAccess.PUBLIC_AND_PRIVATE`), and the VPC contains **private** subnets, the Lambda function will be provisioned inside the VPC and use the private subnets to interact with the cluster. This is the common use-case.

If the endpoint does not expose private access (via `EndpointAccess.PUBLIC`) **or** the VPC does not contain private subnets, the function will not be provisioned within the VPC.

#### Cluster Handler

The `ClusterHandler` is a Lambda function responsible to interact the EKS API in order to control the cluster lifecycle. At the moment, this function cannot be provisioned inside the VPC. See [Attach all Lambda Function to a VPC](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/9509) for more details.

### Kubectl Support

The resources are created in the cluster by running `kubectl apply` from a python lambda function. You can configure the environment of this function by specifying it at cluster instantiation. For example, this can be useful in order to configure an http proxy:

```typescript
const cluster = new eks.Cluster(this, 'hello-eks', {
  version: eks.KubernetesVersion.V1_16,
  kubectlEnvironment: {
    'http_proxy': 'http://proxy.myproxy.com'
  }
});
```

By default, the `kubectl`, `helm` and `aws` commands used to operate the cluster are provided by an AWS Lambda Layer from the AWS Serverless Application in [aws-lambda-layer-kubectl](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-lambda-layer-kubectl). In most cases this should be sufficient.

You can provide a custom layer in case the default layer does not meet your
needs or if the SAR app is not available in your region.

```ts
// custom build:
const layer = new lambda.LayerVersion(this, 'KubectlLayer', {
  code: lambda.Code.fromAsset(`${__dirname}/layer.zip`)),
  compatibleRuntimes: [lambda.Runtime.PROVIDED]
});

// or, a specific version or appid of aws-lambda-layer-kubectl:
const layer = new eks.KubectlLayer(this, 'KubectlLayer', {
  version: '2.0.0',    // optional
  applicationId: '...' // optional
});
```

Pass it to `kubectlLayer` when you create or import a cluster:

```ts
const cluster = new eks.Cluster(this, 'MyCluster', {
  kubectlLayer: layer,
});

// or
const cluster = eks.Cluster.fromClusterAttributes(this, 'MyCluster', {
  kubectlLayer: layer,
});
```

> Instructions on how to build `layer.zip` can be found
> [here](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-lambda-layer-kubectl/blob/master/cdk/README.md).

### ARM64 Support

Instance types with `ARM64` architecture are supported in both managed nodegroup and self-managed capacity. Simply specify an ARM64 `instanceType` (such as `m6g.medium`), and the latest
Amazon Linux 2 AMI for ARM64 will be automatically selected.

```ts
// add a managed ARM64 nodegroup
cluster.addNodegroupCapacity('extra-ng-arm', {
  instanceType: new ec2.InstanceType('m6g.medium'),
  minSize: 2,
});

// add a self-managed ARM64 nodegroup
cluster.addAutoScalingGroupCapacity('self-ng-arm', {
  instanceType: new ec2.InstanceType('m6g.medium'),
  minCapacity: 2,
})
```

### Masters Role

When you create a cluster, you can specify a `mastersRole`. The `Cluster` construct will associate this role with the `system:masters` [RBAC](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/) group, giving it super-user access to the cluster.

```ts
const role = new iam.Role(...);
new eks.Cluster(this, 'HelloEKS', {
  version: eks.KubernetesVersion.V1_17,
  mastersRole: role,
});
```

If you do not specify it, a default role will be created on your behalf, that can be assumed by anyone in the account with `sts:AssumeRole` permissions for this role.

This is the role you see as part of the stack outputs mentioned in the [Quick Start](#quick-start).

```console
$ aws eks update-kubeconfig --name cluster-xxxxx --role-arn arn:aws:iam::112233445566:role/yyyyy
Added new context arn:aws:eks:rrrrr:112233445566:cluster/cluster-xxxxx to /home/boom/.kube/config
```

The default value is `eks.EndpointAccess.PUBLIC_AND_PRIVATE`. Which means the cluster endpoint is accessible from outside of your VPC, but worker node traffic and `kubectl` commands issued by this library stay within your VPC.

### Encryption

When you create an Amazon EKS cluster, envelope encryption of Kubernetes secrets using the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) can be enabled.
The documentation on [creating a cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/create-cluster.html)
can provide more details about the customer master key (CMK) that can be used for the encryption.

You can use the `secretsEncryptionKey` to configure which key the cluster will use to encrypt Kubernetes secrets. By default, an AWS Managed key will be used.

> This setting can only be specified when the cluster is created and cannot be updated.

```ts
const secretsKey = new kms.Key(this, 'SecretsKey');
const cluster = new eks.Cluster(this, 'MyCluster', {
  secretsEncryptionKey: secretsKey,
  // ...
});
```

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for that CMK can be retrieved.

```ts
const clusterEncryptionConfigKeyArn = cluster.clusterEncryptionConfigKeyArn;
```

## Permissions and Security

Amazon EKS provides several mechanism of securing the cluster and granting permissions to specific IAM users and roles.

### AWS IAM Mapping

As described in the [Amazon EKS User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/eks/latest/userguide/add-user-role.html), you can map AWS IAM users and roles to [Kubernetes Role-based access control (RBAC)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac).

The Amazon EKS construct manages the *aws-auth* `ConfigMap` Kubernetes resource on your behalf and exposes an API through the `cluster.awsAuth` for mapping
users, roles and accounts.

Furthermore, when auto-scaling group capacity is added to the cluster, the IAM instance role of the auto-scaling group will be automatically mapped to RBAC so nodes can connect to the cluster. No manual mapping is required.

For example, let's say you want to grant an IAM user administrative privileges on your cluster:

```ts
const adminUser = new iam.User(this, 'Admin');
cluster.awsAuth.addUserMapping(adminUser, { groups: [ 'system:masters' ]});
```

A convenience method for mapping a role to the `system:masters` group is also available:

```ts
cluster.awsAuth.addMastersRole(role)
```

### Cluster Security Group

When you create an Amazon EKS cluster, a [cluster security group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/sec-group-reqs.html)
is automatically created as well. This security group is designed to allow all traffic from the control plane and managed node groups to flow freely
between each other.

The ID for that security group can be retrieved after creating the cluster.

```ts
const clusterSecurityGroupId = cluster.clusterSecurityGroupId;
```

### Node SSH Access

If you want to be able to SSH into your worker nodes, you must already have an SSH key in the region you're connecting to and pass it when
you add capacity to the cluster. You must also be able to connect to the hosts (meaning they must have a public IP and you
should be allowed to connect to them on port 22):

See [SSH into nodes](test/example.ssh-into-nodes.lit.ts) for a code example.

If you want to SSH into nodes in a private subnet, you should set up a bastion host in a public subnet. That setup is recommended, but is
unfortunately beyond the scope of this documentation.

### Service Accounts

With services account you can provide Kubernetes Pods access to AWS resources.

```ts
// add service account
const sa = cluster.addServiceAccount('MyServiceAccount');

const bucket = new Bucket(this, 'Bucket');
bucket.grantReadWrite(serviceAccount);

const mypod = cluster.addManifest('mypod', {
  apiVersion: 'v1',
  kind: 'Pod',
  metadata: { name: 'mypod' },
  spec: {
    serviceAccountName: sa.serviceAccountName
    containers: [
      {
        name: 'hello',
        image: 'paulbouwer/hello-kubernetes:1.5',
        ports: [ { containerPort: 8080 } ],

      }
    ]
  }
});

// create the resource after the service account.
mypod.node.addDependency(sa);

// print the IAM role arn for this service account
new cdk.CfnOutput(this, 'ServiceAccountIamRole', { value: sa.role.roleArn })
```

Note that using `sa.serviceAccountName` above **does not** translate into a resource dependency.
This is why an explicit dependency is needed. See https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/9910 for more details.

## Applying Kubernetes Resources

The library supports several popular resource deployment mechanisms, among which are:

### Kubernetes Manifests

The `KubernetesManifest` construct or `cluster.addManifest` method can be used
to apply Kubernetes resource manifests to this cluster.

> When using `cluster.addManifest`, the manifest construct is defined within the cluster's stack scope. If the manifest contains
> attributes from a different stack which depend on the cluster stack, a circular dependency will be created and you will get a synth time error.
> To avoid this, directly use `new KubernetesManifest` to create the manifest in the scope of the other stack.

The following examples will deploy the [paulbouwer/hello-kubernetes](https://github.com/paulbouwer/hello-kubernetes)
service on the cluster:

```ts
const appLabel = { app: "hello-kubernetes" };

const deployment = {
  apiVersion: "apps/v1",
  kind: "Deployment",
  metadata: { name: "hello-kubernetes" },
  spec: {
    replicas: 3,
    selector: { matchLabels: appLabel },
    template: {
      metadata: { labels: appLabel },
      spec: {
        containers: [
          {
            name: "hello-kubernetes",
            image: "paulbouwer/hello-kubernetes:1.5",
            ports: [ { containerPort: 8080 } ]
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
};

const service = {
  apiVersion: "v1",
  kind: "Service",
  metadata: { name: "hello-kubernetes" },
  spec: {
    type: "LoadBalancer",
    ports: [ { port: 80, targetPort: 8080 } ],
    selector: appLabel
  }
};

// option 1: use a construct
new KubernetesManifest(this, 'hello-kub', {
  cluster,
  manifest: [ deployment, service ]
});

// or, option2: use `addManifest`
cluster.addManifest('hello-kub', service, deployment);
```

#### Adding resources from a URL

The following example will deploy the resource manifest hosting on remote server:

```ts
import * as yaml from 'js-yaml';
import * as request from 'sync-request';

const manifestUrl = 'https://url/of/manifest.yaml';
const manifest = yaml.safeLoadAll(request('GET', manifestUrl).getBody());
cluster.addManifest('my-resource', ...manifest);
```

#### Dependencies

There are cases where Kubernetes resources must be deployed in a specific order.
For example, you cannot define a resource in a Kubernetes namespace before the
namespace was created.

You can represent dependencies between `KubernetesManifest`s using
`resource.node.addDependency()`:

```ts
const namespace = cluster.addManifest('my-namespace', {
  apiVersion: 'v1',
  kind: 'Namespace',
  metadata: { name: 'my-app' }
});

const service = cluster.addManifest('my-service', {
  metadata: {
    name: 'myservice',
    namespace: 'my-app'
  },
  spec: // ...
});

service.node.addDependency(namespace); // will apply `my-namespace` before `my-service`.
```

**NOTE:** when a `KubernetesManifest` includes multiple resources (either directly
or through `cluster.addManifest()`) (e.g. `cluster.addManifest('foo', r1, r2,
r3,...)`), these resources will be applied as a single manifest via `kubectl`
and will be applied sequentially (the standard behavior in `kubectl`).

----------------------

Since Kubernetes manifests are implemented as CloudFormation resources in the
CDK. This means that if the manifest is deleted from your code (or the stack is
deleted), the next `cdk deploy` will issue a `kubectl delete` command and the
Kubernetes resources in that manifest will be deleted.

#### Caveat

If you have multiple resources in a single `KubernetesManifest`, and one of those **resources** is removed from the manifest, it will not be deleted and will remain orphan. See [Support Object pruning](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/10495) for more details.

### Helm Charts

The `HelmChart` construct or `cluster.addHelmChart` method can be used
to add Kubernetes resources to this cluster using Helm.

> When using `cluster.addHelmChart`, the manifest construct is defined within the cluster's stack scope. If the manifest contains
> attributes from a different stack which depend on the cluster stack, a circular dependency will be created and you will get a synth time error.
> To avoid this, directly use `new HelmChart` to create the chart in the scope of the other stack.

The following example will install the [NGINX Ingress Controller](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/) to your cluster using Helm.

```ts
// option 1: use a construct
new HelmChart(this, 'NginxIngress', {
  cluster,
  chart: 'nginx-ingress',
  repository: 'https://helm.nginx.com/stable',
  namespace: 'kube-system'
});

// or, option2: use `addHelmChart`
cluster.addHelmChart('NginxIngress', {
  chart: 'nginx-ingress',
  repository: 'https://helm.nginx.com/stable',
  namespace: 'kube-system'
});
```

Helm charts will be installed and updated using `helm upgrade --install`, where a few parameters
are being passed down (such as `repo`, `values`, `version`, `namespace`, `wait`, `timeout`, etc).
This means that if the chart is added to CDK with the same release name, it will try to update
the chart in the cluster.

Helm charts are implemented as CloudFormation resources in CDK.
This means that if the chart is deleted from your code (or the stack is
deleted), the next `cdk deploy` will issue a `helm uninstall` command and the
Helm chart will be deleted.

When there is no `release` defined, the chart will be installed using the `node.uniqueId`,
which will be lower cased and truncated to the last 63 characters.

By default, all Helm charts will be installed concurrently. In some cases, this
could cause race conditions where two Helm charts attempt to deploy the same
resource or if Helm charts depend on each other. You can use
`chart.node.addDependency()` in order to declare a dependency order between
charts:

```ts
const chart1 = cluster.addHelmChart(...);
const chart2 = cluster.addHelmChart(...);

chart2.node.addDependency(chart1);
```

## Patching Kubernetes Resources

The `KubernetesPatch` construct can be used to update existing kubernetes
resources. The following example can be used to patch the `hello-kubernetes`
deployment from the example above with 5 replicas.

```ts
new KubernetesPatch(this, 'hello-kub-deployment-label', {
  cluster,
  resourceName: "deployment/hello-kubernetes",
  applyPatch: { spec: { replicas: 5 } },
  restorePatch: { spec: { replicas: 3 } }
})
```

## Querying Kubernetes Resources

The `KubernetesObjectValue` construct can be used to query for information about kubernetes objects,
and use that as part of your CDK application.

For example, you can fetch the address of a [`LoadBalancer`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#loadbalancer) type service:

```typescript
// query the load balancer address
const myServiceAddress = new KubernetesObjectValue(this, 'LoadBalancerAttribute', {
  cluster: cluster,
  resourceType: 'service',
  resourceName: 'my-service',
  jsonPath: '.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname', // https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/jsonpath/
});

// pass the address to a lambda function
const proxyFunction = new lambda.Function(this, 'ProxyFunction', {
  ...
  environment: {
    myServiceAddress: myServiceAddress.value
  },
})
```

Specifically, since the above use-case is quite common, there is an easier way to access that information:

```typescript
const loadBalancerAddress = cluster.getServiceLoadBalancerAddress('my-service');
```

## Using existing clusters

The Amazon EKS library allows defining Kubernetes resources such as [Kubernetes
manifests](#kubernetes-resources) and [Helm charts](#helm-charts) on clusters
that are not defined as part of your CDK app.

First, you'll need to "import" a cluster to your CDK app. To do that, use the
`eks.Cluster.fromClusterAttributes()` static method:

```ts
const cluster = eks.Cluster.fromClusterAttributes(this, 'MyCluster', {
  clusterName: 'my-cluster-name',
  kubectlRoleArn: 'arn:aws:iam::1111111:role/iam-role-that-has-masters-access',
});
```

Then, you can use `addManifest` or `addHelmChart` to define resources inside
your Kubernetes cluster. For example:

```ts
cluster.addManifest('Test', {
  apiVersion: 'v1',
  kind: 'ConfigMap',
  metadata: {
    name: 'myconfigmap',
  },
  data: {
    Key: 'value',
    Another: '123454',
  },
});
```

At the minimum, when importing clusters for `kubectl` management, you will need
to specify:

- `clusterName` - the name of the cluster.
- `kubectlRoleArn` - the ARN of an IAM role mapped to the `system:masters` RBAC
  role. If the cluster you are importing was created using the AWS CDK, the
  CloudFormation stack has an output that includes an IAM role that can be used.
  Otherwise, you can create an IAM role and map it to `system:masters` manually.
  The trust policy of this role should include the the
  `arn:aws::iam::${accountId}:root` principal in order to allow the execution
  role of the kubectl resource to assume it.

If the cluster is configured with private-only or private and restricted public
Kubernetes [endpoint access](#endpoint-access), you must also specify:

- `kubectlSecurityGroupId` - the ID of an EC2 security group that is allowed
  connections to the cluster's control security group. For example, the EKS managed [cluster security group](#cluster-security-group).
- `kubectlPrivateSubnetIds` - a list of private VPC subnets IDs that will be used
  to access the Kubernetes endpoint.
